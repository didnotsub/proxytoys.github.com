	<h1 id="20150423"><b>Apr 23, 2015</b> ProxyToys moved to GitHub</h1>
      <p>ProxyToys lost its traditionally home with the shutdown of Codehaus. The project is now hosted
      at GitHub and will use it's infrastructure for source code management, issue management, and hosting
      of the web site. Google Groups have been chosen as new home for the project's
      <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/proxytoys">mailing list</a>.</p>
      <p>Thanks to Ben and Bob for providing the service at Codehaus for more than a decade.</p>

	<h1 id="20100513"><b>May 13, 2010</b> ProxyToys 1.0 released</h1>
      <p>We are proud to present ProxyToys 1.0! Nearly 11 months after starting to re-engineer the last release for
      complete Java 5 support, ProxyToys is up-to-date with the current Java technology again, contains new toys
      for asynchronous and privileged execution and uses a modern build environment again.</p>
      <p>For complete Java 5 support we had to break compatibility with older versions, but the usage pattern is
      different with the new builders anyway.</p>

	<h1 id="20090629"><b>Jun 29, 2009</b> Welcome Paul Hammant as new committer</h1>
      <p>Paul expressed his interest in advancing ProxyToys to the next level: Java 5 support, builder patterns and update
      the build environment to Maven 2. Something we had on our list for years. He also managed to bring in the two 
      Thoughtworkers Juan Li and Tianshuo Deng for a limited time to do some of the tedious work. Welcome!</p>

	<h1 id="20050928"><b>Sep 28, 2005</b> ProxyToys improves Quality Assurance</h1>
      <p>ProxyToys uses now the 
      <a href="http://ci.codehaus.org/beetlejuice/viewProjectSummary.action?projectName=ProxyToys">Beetlejuice</a> 
      continuous integration platform to ensure code quality in the Subversion repository. With the Beetlejuice installation
      at Codehaus every developer can quite immediately see, if his changes affect the build of ProxyToys badly. Additionally
      the website has now a report for the unit tests. Both topics are linked in the menu of the project.</p>
      
    <h1 id="20050905"><b>Sep 5, 2005</b> ProxyToys 0.2.1 released</h1>
      <p>Announcement of the ProxyToys 0.2.1. The delegating toy had unfortunately a different
      delegation mode as default that could not be changed if also a specific ProxyFactory 
      implementation was used. This has been corrected and caused this maintenance release.</p>

    <h1 id="20050904"><b>Sep 4, 2005</b> ProxyToys 0.2 released</h1>
      <p>We proudly present our new release 0.2 of ProxyToys. ProxyToys
      delivers two intercheangable  Proxy factory implementations based on 
      JDK and CGLIB. It contains several solutions (toys) for standard use cases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Decorators - for simple AOP-like chained method interception.</li>
        <li>Delegators - for delegating calls to different objects and supports implementation hiding.</li>
        <li>Dispatchers - for dispatching calls to objects with distinct interfaces.</li>
        <li>Echo proxy - for writing any call into a PrintStream before it is executed.</li>
        <li>Failover proxy - fails over to a next object in case of an exception.</li>
        <li>Hot swapping proxy - allows the exchange of the proxied object on the fly.</li>
        <li>Multicasting proxy - for multicasting a method invocation to multiple objects.</li>
        <li>Null objects - for default implementations of classes that do nothing.</li>
        <li>Pool - for a pool implementation that automatically collects unused instances again.</li>
      </ul>
