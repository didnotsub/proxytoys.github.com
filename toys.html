		<h1 id="Decorating">Decorating Toy</h1>
		
		<p>The <a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/decorate/Decorating.html">Decorating Toy</a> is factory for 
		AOP-style proxies. Any method call is intercepted and can be decorated with an 
		<a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/decorate/Decorator.html">Decorator</a> implementation. In
		addition to method calls, you may also intercept the return of the call or any thrown exception. See the 
		<a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/decorate/package-summary.html">package description</a>	for
		examples.</p>

        <h1 id="Delegating">Delegating Toy</h1>

		<p>The <a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/delegate/Delegating.html">Delegating Toy</a> is a factory for
		proxies, that delegate any call to another object. Depending on the operation mode of the proxy may the target object 
		implement the proxy type or may just have compatible methods. This is a very common pattern and the 
		<a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/delegate/DelegatingInvoker.html">DelegatingInvoker</a> is a
		base class for some other proxy toys implementations. See the 
		<a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/delegate/package-summary.html">package description</a> for
		examples.</p>

        <h1 id="Dispatcher">Dispatching Toy</h1>

		<p>The <a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/dispatch/Dispatching.html">Dispatching Toy</a> is a factory for
		proxies, dispatch incoming method calls to different object depending their implemented interfaces. Each proxy implements
		several unrelated interfaces and contains a collection of target objects. Each method call is invoked on one target object 
		from this collection, that implements the interface of the calling method. Although the 
		<a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/dispatch/DispatchingInvoker.html">DispatchingInvoker</a> is not
		derived from a <a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/delegate/DelegatingInvoker.html">DelegatingInvoker</a>
		it utilizes this invoker internally. See the 
		<a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/dispatch/package-summary.html">package description</a> for
		examples.</p>

        <h1 id="Echo">Echoing Toy</h1>

		<p>The <a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/echo/Echoing.html">Echo Toy</a> is a factory for
		proxies, that implement a classical trace functionality. It implements just an own
		<a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/decorate/Decorator.html">Decorator</a> 
		(<a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/echo/EchoDecorator.html">EchoDecorator</a>), that
		simply writes every method call, the return value and every thrown exception to a 
		<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/io/PrintWriter.html">PrintWriter</a>. See the 
		<a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/echo/package-summary.html">package description</a> for

        <h1 id="Failover">Failover Toy</h1>

		<p>The <a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/failover/Failover.html">Failover Toy</a> is a factory for
		proxies, that implement a failover strategy. Each proxy has a pool of objects, that will be used one by one after a 
		predefined exception type for the current target object is thrown during a method invocation. The 
		<a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/failover/FailoverInvoker.html">FailoverInvoker</a> is a subclass
		of the <a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/hotswap/HotSwappingInvoker.html">HotSwappingInvoker</a>.
		See the 
		<a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/failover/package-summary.html">package description</a> for
		examples.</p>

        <h1 id="Failover">Future Toy</h1>

		<p>The <a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/future/Future.html">Future Toy</a> is a factory for
		proxies, that executes any method call asynchronously. The immediate returned object of such a call is itself a 
		<a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/hotswap/HotSwapping.html">HotSwapping</a> proxy stuffed
		with a <a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/nullobject/Null.html">Null</a> object until the method
		returns. The Null proxy is then hot swapped with the returned object. See the 
		<a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/future/package-summary.html">package description</a> for
		examples.</p>

        <!-- ************ -->

        <h1 id="HotSwap">HotSwapping Toy</h1>

		<p>The <a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/hotswap/HotSwapping.html">Hot Swapping Toy</a> is a 
		factory for proxies, that enable the transparent exchange of the target object for the method invocations. Each created 
		proxy implements the <a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/hotswap/Swappable.html">Swappable</a>
		interface, that is used to do the exchange. Other object that have a reference to a hot swapping proxy, will not notice
		the internal change of the target object at all. The 
		<a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/hotswap/HotSwappingInvoker.html">HotSwappingInvoker</a> is a 
		subclass of the <a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/delegate/DelegatingInvoker.html">DelegatingInvoker</a>.
		See the 
		<a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/hotswap/package-summary.html">package description</a> for

        <h1 id="Multicast">Multicasting Toy</h1>

		<p>The <a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/multicast/Multicasting.html">Multicasting Toy</a> is a factory for
		proxies, that will invoke a single method call on every object which they manage in a collection. The different return values
		are collected and a new multicasting proxy is returned for the result collection. If the result of the invoked method is a 
		primitive type, the proxy will sum up all the results and return this sum as result of the invocation. It does not matter if
		one of the target object in the collection does not have a method like the one invoked on the proxy, those objects are
		simply ignored for the routed method invocation. Each multicasting proxy additionally implements the
		<a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/multicast/Multicast.html">Multicast</a> interface, that permits access
		to the target object collection of such a proxy. See the 
		<a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/multicast/package-summary.html">package description</a> for
		examples.</p>

        <!-- ************ -->

        <h1 id="Null">Null Toy</h1>

		<p>The <a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/nullobject/Null.html">Null Toy</a> is a factory for
		proxies, that work as dummy implementations. The proxy will ignore any called methods returning <tt>void</tt>,
		will return the native <tt>null</tt> vale for all primitive types, will return a new Null proxy for all returned objects it
		can create a new proxy for or simply <tt>null</tt>. See the 
		<a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/nullobject/package-summary.html">package description</a> for
		examples.</p>

        <!-- ************ -->

        <h1 id="Pool">Pool Toy</h1>

		<p>The <a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/pool/Pool.html">Pool Toy</a> is a simple pool implementation
		based on proxies. Each pool is stuffed with a number of objects that are used as pool resources. Any object returned from
		the pool is wrapped with a proxy, that implements the
		<a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/pool/Poolable.html">Multicast</a> interface, that can be used to return
		the object to the pool. Additionally any of these objects will return automatically to the pool if their proxy instance is garbage
		collected. Before an object is added again to the pool after usage, a user-defined 
		<a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/kit/Resetter.html">Resetter</a> instance may do any reinitializations
		with such an object or may even decide to discard the object at all. See the 
		<a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/pool/package-summary.html">package description</a> for
		examples.</p>

        <h1 id="Privileging">Privileging Toy</h1>

		<p>The <a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/privilege/Privileging.html">Privileging Toy</a> is a factory for
		proxies, that execute any call as 
		<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/security/PrivilegedExceptionAction.html">privileged action</a>
		by an <a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/proxy/toys/privilege/ActionExecutor.html">ActionExecutor</a> in a predefined
		context. Such a context can be defined by an active
		<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/SecurityManager.html">SecurityManager</a> that requires an
		<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/security/ActionController.html">ActionController</a> or a JEE container
		using different credentials to execute some functionality using a different
