    <p>ProxyToys is nothing without contributions from the user community.  There are many ways to
    contribute.  We are constantly working on the software and documentation, so it's a good
    idea to contact the team on the <a href="mailing-lists.html">user or development mailing lists</a>
    to avoid duplicating effort.</p>

    <h1 id="documentation">Documentation</h1>
    <p>One of the traditional weak points of open source software is the documentation.  Any
    help with this aspect of the project will be welcomed with open arms, or at the very least
    with open email clients!</p>
    <p>The documentation is in plain HTML and
        <a href="https://github.com/proxytoys/proxytoys/tree/master/website/src/site/content/">held in Git</a></p>

    <h1 id="examples">Examples</h1>
    <p>We are working on examples of using ProxyToys, but we can always do with more.</p>

    <p>The examples are proper Java source files and
        <a href="https://github.com/proxytoys/proxytoys/tree/master/example-code/src/main/java/proxytoys/examples/overview/">
            held in Git</a></p>

    <h1 id="feature-requests">Feature Requests</h1>
    <p>If you want to request a new feature you can either make a request through the 
    <a href="https://github.com/proxytoys/proxytoys/issues">issue tracker</a> or by sending a message to the
    <a href="mailing-lists.html">development mailing list</a>.  The benefit of any new features
    will be discussed on the mailing list, so its a good idea to sign up so that you can make your voice heard.</p>

    <h1 id="bug-reports">Bug Reports</h1>
    <p>You can report bugs through the <a href="https://github.com/proxytoys/proxytoys/issues">issue tracker</a> (preferred)
    interface or the <a href="mailing-lists.html">development mailing list</a>.  We love bug reports that
        include a failing unit test.</p>

    <h1 id="patches">Bug Fixes</h1>
    <p>Better than issues in the bug tracker with failing unit tests, are issues with unit tests, <b>and</b> a fix.
        Bug fixes are best sent as patches that we can apply to the
    codebase.  Remember to tell us which version the patch should be applied against if not the current trunk, or
    we could get very confused.  To be accepted into the codebase, patches must be released
    under the <a href="license.html">same license as ProxyToys itself</a>.</p>

    <h1 id="new-code">New Code</h1>
    <p>If you have a new feature request, then we'll listen extra hard if you show us how it
    works.  A new feature might be best implemented as a patch to an existing class
    or as a new class.  The ProxyToys API contains many extension points that allow new functionality
    to be integrated into the framework.  We are rather strict about testing, so if you send us
    some code without any tests we will probably ask you to write the tests tests as well
    before we add it to the codebase.</p>

    <h1 id="your-own-extension">Write Your Own ProxyToys Extension</h1>
    <p>If you have a project that builds upon ProxyToys, and are unwilling to donate, then we will be happy to announce your
    project on the ProxyToys site.</p>

    <h1>Become a Committer</h1>
    <p>Simply show some interest in bug fixes and submissions, we'll expand the core team easily.</p>
